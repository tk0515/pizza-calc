# Pizza Calculator

A calculator to determine what your pizza order should be based on number of people and preferred toppings. 
Pizza calculator will have a 'Login' mode as well as a 'Guest' mode. 'Login' mode will allow the user to save people(family members,
friends, etcs.) for future pizza orders and more precise calculations. May include the ability to edit people, as pizza preferences may
change. This portion will utilize a SQL database. The 'Guest' mode will allow for a user to quickly get their pizza calculation by just
inputting the number of people who wish to eat pizza and the enjoyed toppings among the group. This calculation will not be as precise,
but will get the job done quickly.
